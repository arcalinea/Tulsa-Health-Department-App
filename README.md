# Troubleshooting
If running into trouble with react-native camera module: 
- Is build.gradle added to react-native-camera?
- Is AndroidManifest.xml under android/src/main?

Go to the github page for react-native-camera for installation instruction:
https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera

Need to do this: 
- npm install react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save
